Covid-19 is a disease that has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Many people have lost their loved ones and their jobs because of it. The impact of this virus goes beyond health â€“ it affects our economies and the environment. In this study, we focus on three distinct research questions, each aiming to shed light on the interactions between COVID-19 deaths and different factors.

## Question One: Does the number of COVID-19 deaths depend on GDP and income?

In the first question, we investigate the potential influence of economic indicators on COVID-19 mortality. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a widely recognized measure of a state's economic health, while per capita personal income reflects the income distribution among the population. Understanding the connection between these economic factors and COVID-19 deaths is crucial in assessing the pandemic's social and economic implications. To answer this question, we employ linear regression analysis with interaction effects to uncover the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and GDP and income in Texas during the year 2021.
