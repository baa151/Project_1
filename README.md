# Project_1
Covid-19 is a disease that has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Many people have lost their loved ones and their jobs because of it. The impact of this virus goes beyond health â€“ it affects our economies and the environment. In this study, we focus on three distinct research questions, each aiming to shed light on the interactions between COVID-19 deaths and different factors.
