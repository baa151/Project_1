Covid-19 is a disease that has caused millions of deaths worldwide. Many people have lost their loved ones and their jobs because of it. The impact of this virus goes beyond health â€“ it affects our economies and the environment. In this study, we focus on three distinct research questions, each aiming to shed light on the interactions between COVID-19 deaths and different factors.

## Question One: Does the number of COVID-19 deaths depend on GDP and income?

In the first question, we investigate the potential influence of economic indicators on COVID-19 mortality. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a widely recognized measure of a state's economic health, while per capita personal income reflects the income distribution among the population. Understanding the connection between these economic factors and COVID-19 deaths is crucial in assessing the pandemic's social and economic implications. To answer this question, we employ linear regression analysis with interaction effects to uncover the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and GDP and income in Texas during the year 2021.

## Question Two: Do states with warmer environments have a higher number of COVID-19 deaths?

The second question delves into the environmental factors affecting COVID-19 deaths. Specifically, we aim to determine whether states with warmer climates experience a higher number of COVID-19 fatalities in the year 2021. The motivation behind this question lies in the potential impact of temperature and humidity on the transmission and survival of the virus. We plan to employ U-test analysis to compare COVID-19 deaths between Texas, a state with a relatively warm climate, and Michigan, a state with colder weather, in order to assess the relationship between climate and COVID-19 mortality.

## Question Three: Do higher unemployment rates in 2021 in Florida compared to Alabama result in higher COVID-19 deaths?

The third question revolves around the interplay between employment rates and COVID-19 mortality. The economic consequences of the pandemic, including job losses, have been substantial. To gain a deeper understanding of this aspect, we will investigate whether higher unemployment levels in Florida compared to Alabama in 2021 resulted in a greater number of COVID-19 deaths. This analysis helps us assess the social and health impacts of economic disparities during the pandemic. We plan to use U-test analysis to compare COVID-19 deaths between the two states, shedding light on the potential correlation between unemployment and COVID-19 mortality.
